This B2B portal is developed using Spring 6, Maven 3, Spring Boot 3, REST API, MySQL 8, JPA, Docker, JWT, DotNet Web API Core, SQL Server, Entity Framework Core, and React.js. The project is sponsored by a leasing company, while the primary users are rental car companies who are customers of the sponsor and require a fleet of cars on lease. The system enables users to choose a car and configure it based on predefined conditions for each model. The vehicle cost dynamically adjusts according to the configuration. The system, backed by a MySQL database, ensures ease of maintenance. Upon a successful transaction, an invoice containing all vehicle details is generated and sent to users via email in PDF format.
